				<h2>About</h2>
				<p class = "about-text">
					Hi there, I'm Barak Daniel, a 28-year-old software engineering student at Shankar College living in Petah Tikva with my spouse. I've had a diverse career path that included working my way up from lead salesman to sales center manager at an insurance company, and later serving as the CEO of a low-tech company. Despite my successes, I knew my true passion was becoming a software engineer, which led me to pursue my dream.
					<br><br>
					In addition to my career, I'm also an entrepreneur at heart. In my free time, I founded two businesses. FunBox, a unique storage solution that helps people better organize their belongings, and EsportIL, an organization dedicated to producing high-quality electronic sports tournaments and leagues in Hebrew for major game titles. We brought together a team of talented casters and sponsors to produce high-quality events, which were streamed live at Twitch.tv for audiences to enjoy. It was incredibly rewarding to see the e-sports community in Israel grow and thrive as a result of our efforts, and I was proud to have played a part in this exciting new industry. Through these experiences, I've gained invaluable insights into business and entrepreneurship that I believe will serve me well as I continue to pursue my goals in software engineering.
					<br><br>
					Now, as a second-year software engineering student, I'm excited to be pursuing my passion and learning everything I can about the field. Whether I'm designing complex systems or writing elegant code, I feel a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment that I've never experienced before. I'm grateful for the opportunities I've had so far and excited for what the future holds as I continue to grow and develop my skills as a software engineer.
